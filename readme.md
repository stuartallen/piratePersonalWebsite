#   Pirate Portfolio Website

Find this site at https://stuartsportfolio.vercel.app/

I made this site after taking Bruno Simon's Threejs Journey. All assets are my own including all the meshes I personally made in blender. The water shader makes use of Stefan Gustavson's Classic Perlin 2D Noise as well as other's helpful code on how to include fog over custom shaders.

To run this project have Node and NPM install. Then download the project and run 'npm install' and then 'npm run dev'
